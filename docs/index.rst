Welcome to Bluefog's documentation!
===================================

Bluefog is a distributed training framework for PyTorch based
on diffusion/consensus-type algorithm.
The goal of Bluefog is to make distributed machine learning fast,
fault-tolerant, friendly to heterogeneuous environment, and easy to use.

.. Note::

    This repository is still under development. Please check it later.
